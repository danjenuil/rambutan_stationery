<!--
The idea is to first check if the user has any outstanding fines or has not maxed out on loan limit (5 items),
then tell that the user has to pay the fines before making more loans.

Else (the user has no outstanding fines and hasn't borrowed anything or still hasn't maxed out),
show all the stationeries that are available for borrowing (not fixed or consumable) minus 
the ones that are not available (out of stock).
